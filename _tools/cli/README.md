## The first CLI Dating Builder Installer Tool 😻 (ever invented! 🪄)


### 🍰 Get started. How to use?

Inside this folder (`_tools/cli`), run `php ph7cms setup:install`

Then, follow the instructions.


## 💡 Good to Know

When using this cli command to install pH7Builder (AKA pH7CMS), you have to make sure that you didn't rename
the `_protected` folder.

The database configuration has less options. For instance, you can't change the prefix when creating the tables in the
database, meaning you won't be able to have two same installations using the same database (if so, you will have to
create a second database, or using the [traditional Web installer](http://ph7builder.com/doc/en/insall) instead).


## 🤔 How pH7Builder CLI installation can be useful

* Scaling the new [pH7Builder](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS) instances by automatizing the
  installation.
* Quick installations on Web hosting/cloud servers.
* Ideal for SaaS services, to automatically run a new pH7Builder instance in the background.
* Quick installation on local stacks for testing purpose.


## 🤕 Troubleshooting
